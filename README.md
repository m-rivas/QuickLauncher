# QuickLauncher
QuickLauncher is a simple experimental project by Michael Garcia-Rivas

## Intent
The focus of QuickLauncher was to familiarize myself with Android development and Android libraries.
Also wouldn't hurt to practive Java while I was at it.

## Structure
Main Activity is the home page of the app. As of now, buttons will kick off different activites to do certain tasks. They'll be called modules.

### Bluetooth Module
This is the first module ever made. It's main goal was to display all devices the phone was bonded to. A RecylcerView is used to display the list of device names.
Eventually, an aruino
